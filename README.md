# CFN-CR-PythonLambdaLayer

CloudFormation Custom Resrouce to build Lambda layers for python scripts based 
on the requirements.txt and/or custom raw python scripts

note: the lambda function with comments, and doc strings is also in the repo
under the name of `lambda_function.py` but into the CFN it's lifted in without
doc strings, due to size limit.
